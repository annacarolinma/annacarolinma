# Hello 🐈‍⬛
I'm Ana, a Software Engineering student and ui/ux designer. Currently, i'm an intern at the city hall of Campinas, São Paulo. 
I work there as a full-stack developer. I'm deeply in love with the technical and design in the aspects of development, and how I can match them for great user experiences, it's ike find a path, for guide those people, in the middle of complexity, simplifying interactions and making their journey more intuitive and enjoyable.
